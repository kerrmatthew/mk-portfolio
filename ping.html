          Ping lets Trade Me members build up a stored balance when they sell things, which they can use to pay for items on the site. Members can pay directly from their bank account, which is new in the NZ market.

          I designed and helped build the site, as well as Ping Core and the integration of payments and management functions across our iOS, Android, legacy fixed width website, and preview responsive angularJS website, used by millions of Trade Me users every month.

        Ping feels the same everywhere. â€¨Icons, behaviour, metaphors, text and information architecture make it feel coherant and simple.
