    <h4 class="heavy">About Me</h4>
    <p>
      I'm a Designer at Trade Me, the unofficial website of New Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a Masters degree in business, and a Design Bachelor focusing on Architecture, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense that I've spent the last 7 years building products for mobile and web.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, I'm pretty good at digital design and building products. I've spun up and killed more startups than I care to admit, and the one I did managed to sell basically scared me off owning a business. And here you find me in a corporate.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I had to describe my work, and I do since this is my portfolio, I'd say I'm honest, easy to work with, proactive, and focused on users. My communication and organisation skills are top notch, albeit a bit casual at times.
      I like to think of myself as an important contributor to a larger team with shared vision; I thrive in a positive environment. I also know when to put the extra efford in to get the outcomes we need.
    </p>

      Look out below for examples of my work, and thanks for taking the time to learn more about yours truely.

      Ping lets Trade Me members build up a stored balance when they sell things, which they can use it to pay for items on the site. Members can pay directly from their bank account, which is new in the NZ market.
